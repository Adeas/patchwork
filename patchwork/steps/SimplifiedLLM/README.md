## Code Documentation

### Inputs
- The code defines typed data structures in `typed.py` that represent the required inputs and optional inputs for a simplified LLM step in a patchwork system. The input structures include fields such as `prompt_user`, `prompt_values`, `prompt_system`, `model`, `openai_api_key`, `patched_api_key`, `google_api_key`, `json`, and `response_partitions`.

### Outputs
- The code implements a `SimplifiedLLM` step that processes inputs and generates outputs in a patchwork workflow. The outputs include lists of prompts, openai responses, and extracted responses based on the input data provided during the step execution. 

### Usage
- The `SimplifiedLLM` step is meant to be part of a larger patchwork system, where it takes specific inputs and processes them to generate required outputs using other specialized steps like `PreparePrompt`, `CallLLM`, and `ExtractModelResponse`.

### Data Structure
- The code utilizes typed dictionaries from `typing_extensions` to define clear structures for inputs and outputs, ensuring type safety and reliability during data processing.
