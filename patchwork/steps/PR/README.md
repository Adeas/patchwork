# Code Documentation

## Inputs
- This code defines a class `PR` with an `__init__` method that takes a dictionary `inputs` as a parameter.

## Outputs
- The `PR` class has a `run` method which calls several other classes (`CommitChanges`, `PreparePR`, `CreatePR`) and returns a dictionary.

## Usage
- The `PR` class is likely used to orchestrate a series of steps related to creating a pull request, encapsulating the logic and input validation required in the process.
